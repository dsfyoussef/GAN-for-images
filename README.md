# GAN-for-images
Anime Face Generator with GANs
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic anime faces from random noise. The code is designed to run on Google Colab and uses TensorFlow.

Key Features:
Google Drive Integration:

The code mounts a Google Drive folder to access training data.
It extracts a ZIP file containing a dataset of anime face images.
Data Preprocessing:

Images are resized to 64x64 pixels.
Pixel values are normalized to the range [-1, 1], suitable for GAN training.
Data Visualization:

Displays a sample of training images to verify their quality and format.
Custom GAN Architecture:

Generator: Produces anime face images from a random noise vector.
Discriminator: Distinguishes between generated and real images.
Loss and Optimization: Uses binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
GAN Training:

Trains the model on image data with separate steps for the generator and discriminator.
Random noise is used to generate new images at each iteration.
Result Visualization:

Generates and saves sample images during training to track the model's progress.
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Matplotlib
NumPy
These dependencies are pre-installed on Google Colab.

Code Structure:
Library Imports and Google Drive Mounting:

Enables access to data stored in your Drive.
Data Preprocessing:

Loads and normalizes images.
GAN Model Definition:

Builds the Generator and Discriminator classes.
Model Training:

Implements training steps and image generation.
Results:

Saves generated images in the /content/output directory.
Running on Google Colab:
Upload the anime face dataset as a ZIP file to your Google Drive.
Mount your Google Drive using the following code:
python
Copier le code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Update the zip_path variable to point to your ZIP file's path in Drive.
Run each code cell to:
Prepare the data.
Train the GAN.
Visualize the results.
Expected Results:
The GAN learns to generate realistic anime faces.
Generated images are saved and displayed after each epoch.
Potential Improvements:
Add metrics like FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) or IS (Inception Score) to evaluate the quality of generated images.
Experiment with advanced architectures like DCGAN or StyleGAN.
Extend the model to generate faces at higher resolutions.
